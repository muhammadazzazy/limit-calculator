# Limit Calculator
This is a Python implementation for a program that computes limits for mathematical expressions including infinite limits. If the value of For this program to work as intended, three distinct inputs are required:
1. Symbol of variable
2. Mathematical expression for which the limit needs to be found
3. Some value

This program requires Python 3 which can be installed from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

First, a virtual environment can be created and activated using the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Then, the required Python packages need to be installed which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file using the command below:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To start the program, run the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
The project idea was obtained from [karan/Projects](https://github.com/karan/Projects#numbers).
